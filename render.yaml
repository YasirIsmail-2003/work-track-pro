# Notes:
# - Replace repo with your GitHub repo URL and branch as needed.
# - Add environment variables and secrets via Render dashboard or envVars above.
# - Render will run the build commands and publish the frontend `dist` folder.
# - The backend is configured as a Node web service that builds the Next app in `server/` and runs `next start`.
# - If you want to use a managed Postgres or other services, add them as resources in Render and connect via env vars.
